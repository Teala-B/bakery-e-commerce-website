_There are arrows on **BOTH** sides of the images and a selction bar at the bottom to help navigate through pictures._

Creating the carousel was a very thought provoking but fufilling experience.
-First was specifying a carousel class then creating the slides for the carosel.

_Must be repeted for **EACH** new slide_

-Next was adding the image and/or text to each slide.

_Images should be about the same size to insure the carousel functions smoothly_

The bottom simply contains text about the website/business and what is offered there.
